## Preface
**This guide is a <u>work in progress</u> and will be updated accordingly.**

After a long hiatus from the hackintosh scene, I'm back in action wasting time trying to get this awful operating system running on this unit again for development purposes.

I've _finally_ managed to get OpenCore running on this machine, after running into nothing but issues with macOS installer failing to load when following other **Kaby Lake** based configurations and examples.  What finally did the trick was basing the OC config [for the USB installer] off a prebuilt package for **Cofeee Lake** instead, and then modifying this after the fact once macOS was installed.

## Quick Installation Notes

- Built the macOS USB installer using [OCLP](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/INSTALLER.html) for macOS Sonoma 14.4.1
	-  _Note this now requires a USB **larger than** 16GB!_
- Based my initial OpenCore USB installer EFI off [this](https://olarila.com/files/OPENCORE1/EFI.Opencore.NoteBook.Coffee.Lake.Whiskey.Lake.zip) prebuilt package available from [olarila.com](https://www.olarila.com/topic/5676-hackintosh-efi-folder-with-clover-and-opencore/) for **"NoteBook CoffeeLake and WhiskeyLake"** based models  _(thank you to [@MaLd0n](https://github.com/MaLd0n))_
	- _The Asus VivoBook S10UA-DS71 is based of the **Kaby Lake Refresh** but following the [Dortainia Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/kaby-lake.html) for this and/or using the prebuilt config from olarila.com for Kaby Lake had issues and the macOS installer would always fail to load and I didn't have the patience to debug why!)_
	- _Using the Coffee Lake prebuit EFI/config to simply get installer to run and then updated config post-install to better suite the Kaby Lake chipset_
		- _and now realize this is likely because the prebuilt Coffee Lake EFI also contains `CpuTscSync.kext`, and `TSC_sync_margin=0` boot arg which prevents this panic_
- After successful install, then copied EFI folder to internal EFI partition and [generated SMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) for `MacBookPro15,2`
- Modified OpenCore `config.plist` and tweaked some values the olarila.com prebuilt EFI folder came with: 
	- Note that the `igfxfw=2` boot arg is set which causes [ failure when loading IGPU firmware](https://elitemacx86.com/threads/how-to-improve-igpu-performance-intel-graphics-on-macos.1059/); This should be removed.
	- Removed the `-igfxblr -igfxblt` boot args to fix backlight/brightness slider
	- Improved brightness slider steps by applying `PNLF to XNLF Rename` [patch](macOS_14.4.1/patch_OC_PNLF to XNLF Rename.plist) to OpenCore that was generated by [SSDTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime) _(under Windows)_.
		- _Did not add/use `SSDT-PNLF.aml`as this is include within the `/ACPI/MaLd0n.aml`provided by prebuilt EFI folder/package._
		- _Debating if `-igfxbls` makes any difference in backlight smoothness_
	- Changed boot arg from `alcid=3` to instead use `alcid=13` to better match Conexant Audio CX8050 and enable internal microphone
	- Removed `DeviceProperties` `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x17,0x0)` device _(not relevant to this machine / Kaby Lake)_
	- Modified graphic properties to better match Intel UHD 620 / Asus-S510UA-DS71 / Kaby Lake R and fix HDMI output _(see below)_
	- Wifi for the Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 can be enabled via the [itlwm 2.3.0-alpha version](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases/tag/v2.3.0-alpha) kext.
		- _Debating if I should set country code via `itlwm_cc=` boot arg_
	- Modified OC to use [BsxDarkFenceLight1](https://github.com/blackosx/BsxDarkFenceLight1) theme
	- Update kexts via [kextupdater](https://github.com/MacThings/kextupdater)
	- _(Optional)_ Configured OpenCore to boot Linix via [OpenLinuxBoot](OpenLinuxBoot) method
	- _Todo:_ Generate [USB Map](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap) _(under Windows)_ and replace `USBInjectAll.kext`
	- _Todo:_ Install and enable [AsusSMC](https://github.com/hieplpvip/AsusSMC) -- follow here for [SSDT patching](https://github.com/hieplpvip/AsusSMC/issues/93) related to this
	- _Note:_ As per [this](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/sleep.html#fixing-gpus) the `forceRenderStandby=0` boot arge may be needed if kernel panic on sleep occurs; `-noDC9` is another arg currently present due to Coffee Lake prebuilt, not sure if needed
	- Still tweaking and improving, will update here accordingly.
